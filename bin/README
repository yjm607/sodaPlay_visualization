GOAL: Extend program's functionality without jeopardizing code flexibility

ADDED FUNCTIONALITY: 
- Fixed mass. Implemented via boolean isFixed field
- Bar. Implemented via forceLengthToNatural() method, which shifts spring's 
  masses along bar axis to set distance between them equal to bar's initial length.
  We found this implementation to be design-wise superior over hardcoding large 
  myK and introducing damping factor for several reasons:
  - Produced animation is much smoother.
  - Very little code was written to implement it. 
  - Code would use functions already present in Mass class.
  - We could reuse functionality to implement Muscle (see next).
- Muscle. Is a bar with variable myLength. Inherits Spring class. Changes the natural
  length periodically within the amplitude. Then uses inherited forceLengthToNatural() 
  to move masses.

KNOWN ISSUES: None
